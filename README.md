Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the manner in which they did the exercise, using the "classe" variable in the training set. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways: 
. exactly according to the specification (Class A),
. throwing the elbows to the front (Class B),
. lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C),
. lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
. throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Other variables may be used for prediction. A report should be created describing how the model was built, how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is, and why certain choices were made. The prediction model will also be used to predict 20 different test cases.
